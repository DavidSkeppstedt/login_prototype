# A Login Prototype with Go and Martini.
A toy app to learn Go web programming.
This handles a REST-api for which should be used for a client app that can login and logout etc.

## Dependencies
So far we have these dependencies that you can easily fetch with
	go get github.com/_name_of_dep

* [Martini](https://github.com/go-martini/martini)
* [PostgreSQL adapter](https://github.com/lib/pq)

You would have to have Go set up correctly ofcourse.
